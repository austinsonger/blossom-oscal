        TBD: ssp-uuid: 73a7ca56-ac02-43b9-8664-62bcb05a7e91 will need to be added for oscal 1.2.0.

        The leveraged authorization assembly is supposed to have a required uuid flag instead of an optional id flag. This will be fixed in the syntax shortly.

        Use one leveraged-authorization assembly for each underlying system. (In the legacy world, these may be general support systems.

        The link fields are optional, but preferred where known. Often, a leveraging system's SSP author will not have access to the leveraged system's SSP, but should have access to the leveraged system's CRM.
